### Paper Abstract
Over the recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have become the primary choice for many image-processing problems. Regarding industrial applications, they are hence especially interesting for automated optical quality inspection. However, with well-optimized processes, it is often not possible to obtain a sufficiently large set of defective samples for CNN-based classification and the training objective shifts from defect classification to anomaly detection. Here, we approach this problem with deep metric learning using triplet networks. Our evaluation shows promising results that even translate to novel defect classes, which were not part of the training data.

### How to Run
• Ensure you have IPython installed (I use it via Jupyter Notebooks and Anaconda). <br />
• Ensure you have installed all the essential libraries mentioned in the first cell in the IPython code file. <br />
• Ensure you have installed the required versions for Python, Keras, and Tensorflow. <br />
• Download the Kyleberg dataset http://www.cb.uu.se/~gustaf/texture/data/without-rotations-zip/ <br />
• Download the DAGM dataset https://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/conference/dagm/2007/prizes.html <br />
• Download the DAGM compeititon dataset https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/node/3616/download/456c3f3f463ad9c64a7daf81f0b7684d <br />
• Run the IPython script cell by cell. <br />
• Viola! Enjoy.
